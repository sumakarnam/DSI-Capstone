    "The current project involves using machine learning models to predict airway pressure in the respiratory circuit of an  [open source ventilator](#https://www.peoplesvent.org/en/latest/) attached to an [artificial test lung](#https://www.ingmarmed.com/product/quicklung/).

    "The global COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a low-cost, rapidly-deployable ventilator, for the current as well as future respiratory virus outbreaks. While safe and robust ventilation technology exists in the commercial sector, the small number of capable suppliers cannot meet the severe demands for ventilators during a pandemic. Moreover, the specialized, proprietary equipment developed by medical device manufacturers is expensive and inaccessible in low-resource areas.\n",

    "The [People’s Ventilator Project (PVP)](https://www.peoplesvent.org/en/latest/) is an open-source, low-cost pressure-control ventilator designed for minimal reliance on specialized medical parts to better adapt to supply chain shortages. This is a project funder and supported by the Princeton University.\n",

    "The first control input is a continuous variable from 0 to 100 representing the percentage the inspiratory valve is open to let air into the lung (i.e., 0 is completely closed and no air is let in and 100 is completely open). The second control input is a binary variable representing whether the expiratory valve is open (1) or closed (0) to let air out.\n",

    "The dataset contains more than 75000 time series of breaths. Each time series represents a 3 second breath and has the values of the control variables (`u_in`, percentage the inspiratory valve is open to let air in and  `u_out`, a binary variable indicating if the expiratory valve is open) and the `pressure`, the airway pressure at 80 timestamps between 1 to 3 seconds. In addition to this, the values of two lung attributes - resistance(`R`) and compliance(`C`) are also available for each breath. \n",

Intuitively, one can imagine blowing up a balloon through a straw. We can change R by changing the diameter of the straw, with higher R being harder to blow. Either 5, 20 or 50\n",
    "- `C` - lung attribute indicating how compliant the lung is (in mL/cmH2O). Physically, this is the change in volume per change in pressure. Intuitively, one can imagine the same balloon example.

This led to dropping 73 (of more than 75000) breaths but still retaining more than 99.9% of the original raw data.

Each breath has an inspiratory phase where the airway pressure increases, reaches a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and the pressure decreses during the expiratory phase.

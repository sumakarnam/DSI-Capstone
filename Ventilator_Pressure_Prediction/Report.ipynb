    "The current project involves using machine learning models to predict airway pressure in the respiratory circuit of an  [open source ventilator](#https://www.peoplesvent.org/en/latest/) attached to an [artificial test lung](#https://www.ingmarmed.com/product/quicklung/). This section includes a high level overview of the workings of the open source ventilator\n",

    "The global COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a low-cost, rapidly-deployable ventilator, for the current as well as future respiratory virus outbreaks. While safe and robust ventilation technology exists in the commercial sector, the small number of capable suppliers cannot meet the severe demands for ventilators during a pandemic. Moreover, the specialized, proprietary equipment developed by medical device manufacturers is expensive and inaccessible in low-resource areas.\n",

    "The [People’s Ventilator Project (PVP)](https://www.peoplesvent.org/en/latest/) is an open-source, low-cost pressure-control ventilator designed for minimal reliance on specialized medical parts to better adapt to supply chain shortages. This is a project funder and supported by the Princeton University.\n",

    "Note: As per the team that designed the PVP, it is not a regulated or clinically validated medical device. It is currently recommended only for research purposes.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first control input is a continuous variable from 0 to 100 representing the percentage the inspiratory valve is open to let air into the lung (i.e., 0 is completely closed and no air is let in and 100 is completely open). The second control input is a binary variable representing whether the expiratory valve is open (1) or closed (0) to let air out.\n",

Each time series represents a 3 second breath and has the values of the control variables (`u_in`, percentage the inspiratory valve is open to let air in and  `u_out`, a binary variable indicating if the expiratory valve is open) and the `pressure`, the airway pressure at 80 timestamps between 1 to 3 seconds. In addition to this, the values of two lung attributes - resistance(`R`) and compliance(`C`) are also available for each breath. \n",

    "- `breath_id` - globally-unique identifier for breaths\n",
    "- `R` - lung attribute indicating how restricted the airway is (in cmH2O/L/S). Physically, this is the change in pressure per change in flow (air volume per time). Intuitively, one can imagine blowing up a balloon through a straw. We can change R by changing the diameter of the straw, with higher R being harder to blow. Either 5, 20 or 50\n",
    "- `C` - lung attribute indicating how compliant the lung is (in mL/cmH2O). Physically, this is the change in volume per change in pressure. Intuitively, one can imagine the same balloon example. We can change C by changing the thickness of the balloon’s latex, with higher C having thinner latex and easier to blow. Either 10, 20 or 50\n",

    "There were a small number of rows (~ 0.0005%) which had negative `pressure` values. The data was cleaned by dropping any breath (entire time series corresponding to a single 3s breath) if it had even one row with negative pressure. This led to dropping 73 (of more than 75000) breaths but still retaining more than 99.9% of the original raw data. The details of this cleaning and EDA can be found in this  [notebook](./code/EDA.ipynb) "
